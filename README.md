> A spiritual scavenger hunt and synchronicity tracker — part Pokémon Go, part Co–Star, part Snapchat — for mapping your awakening and decoding the patterns in your life.

## 🌟 User Story

You're seeing signs everywhere — numbers, animals, names, lyrics, symbols. With Synchronicity Go, you log those moments, track patterns, and connect with others seeing the same signs.

## ⚠️ Vibration Disclaimer

Synchronicity Go is a high-frequency space.  
By creating an account, you agree to:

- Connect to the collective conscious with integrity.
- Use only language aligned with light, growth, truth, and love.
- Never post hate, darkness, or low-vibe projection.

💡 Energy doesn’t care about the medium — vibration transfers here like anywhere else.  
This app is a container for frequency. If your post includes harmful language, it will be flagged before publishing.

🧘‍♀️ If you aren’t in the light, you’re not in the right app.
